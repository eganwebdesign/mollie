                            <p>Her eyelids slid open to the sight of her Rose de Nuit lipstick smeared upon his white linen pillowcase. She smirks, toying with the thought that the stain appears as marked territory. She is submerged by the intimate feeling. Desolate, subdued even. She longs to return to their passionate night of flirtatious banter driven by too many refills of subpar sauvignon blanc. The taste of alcohol lingers still, but the poise that accompanies it has dried up. She turns to face him. Rays piercing through the blinds leave a configuration across his resting face. She studies him, his beauty, in appearance as well as temperament. Purity in her eyes. His demeanor, reserved yet captivation comes with his presence. She wonders if he, or any man, has ever viewed her with such a profound idolization. Gently rolling onto her back as the feeling intensifies. The other woman. Illfully conscious of this verity the entirety of her adolescence. Not a mistress, but the ones whom she infatuates herself with always love another. <em>What is sufficient for a man? Hell, what is beyond sufficiency? How should a woman present herself to fulfill more than his wet dream?</em> She has yet to receive an answer quite concise enough for her liking, nor has she ever been so forthcoming with the fear of her inquisition being met with undesirable perception. She is desirable to the male gaze, haunted by the truth that no figure is forever. <em>A pretty face and slender waist guarantee a woman nothing of substance in life.</em> She is, to her apprehension, the woman who is a short-lived fantasy in his future mind. A potential ponder of what she amounted to, if anything at all, dead or alive, she will from his thoughts once again. The fear of never experiencing sincere, feverish love eats at her. She listens to him breathe, counting his breaths while holding her own, envisioning the woman he loves doing the same. <em>I know he wishes she was in my place, I know he yearns for her.</em> She feels resentment now, knowingly unprovoked, but resentment still. Her hot rancid thoughts bring her up from the sheets. Swiftly dressing and with a hushed haste, goes for the door. <em>Awakening to me in the midst of drowning in my own insanity, the epitome of undesirable, easy categorization of a crazy bitch.</em> Once she hits the street the air refreshes her, as does the Marlboro she shoved in her boot during her grand exit. As she walks she thinks of breakfast.</p>
